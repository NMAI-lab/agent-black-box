# agent-black-box

Notes for the discussion

* What is the ideal debugger/ black box for an agent?
**  What was in the belief base?
- What were the available plans?
- What event triggered and why?
- What were the options? What intention was selected? Why?
- Link from environment, through perceptions, to reasoning state/ state of mind, to action, to effect on the environment
- Tools available today:
- Mind inspector
- Logging perceptions, actions, messages, etc
- Adding diagnostic messages automatically (possible without much implementation effort)
- What is needed?
- Ability for a human to cut through large swaths of irrelevant data to get to the interesting stuff/
- Visually representing the snapshots in a useful way
 

Notes from the discussion
- Look at EMAS for what is out there
-- Why did I do that button
- EXTRAAMAS - all about explanations
-- Doubtful that anyone has tied explanations with BDI
-- What do people mean by explanation for agents?
- Attend as many AAMAS sessions (EXTRAAMAS, EMAS, etc) as I can
- RabbitMQ system for logging - Pub and Sub - connect to a port
-- Launch it as a service, don't need to mess with sockets
-- https://www.rabbitmq.com/
- MAS Competition papers - mention debuggability. Who are they citing?
